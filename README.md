# NLPy
A natural language processing powered transpiler

NLPy allows users to compile executable code with nothing but their voice; powered using Facebook's Wit.ai engine, NLPy uses an ML model to identify and parse input queries for specific commands and tokenizations. Using these NLP powered results, NLPy transpiles the input commands into Python.

Users interact with NLPy by giving series of oral commands such as "increase variable by seventeen" or "add one to x".

Currently, NLPy supports:
- Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment (=)
- Basic Comparisons (<, =, >)
- If statements
- For loops
- Std. Output (Python print statements)
